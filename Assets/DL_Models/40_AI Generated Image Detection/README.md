### BUSINESS PROBLEM
<p style='text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;'>An AI Generated Image Detection model is designed to classify whether an image is generated by an AI or not. With the increasing use of generative models such as GANs and StyleGANs, it has become difficult to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. The model uses machine learning algorithms to identify specific features and patterns that are commonly found in AI-generated images, such as unusual color gradients and pixelation. By accurately classifying images as AI-generated or not, the model can be useful in detecting fake images and preventing their spread. This can be particularly important in areas such as journalism and forensics where the authenticity of images is crucial..</p>

### BUSINESS IMPACT
<p style='text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;'>AI generated image detection plays a crucial role in addressing the challenges associated with fake or manipulated images. By employing image analysis techniques and deep learning algorithms, it enables the detection and identification of AI-generated or manipulated images. Accurate detection of AI-generated images assists in combating misinformation, protecting intellectual property rights, and ensuring the authenticity of visual content. AI generated image detection technology supports content verification, integrity, and trustworthiness, fostering a more reliable and secure digital environment..</p>
