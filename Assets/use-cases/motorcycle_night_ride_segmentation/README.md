### Business Problem 

Motorcycle night ride segmentation involves the automated segmentation or separation of motorcycle objects from nighttime scenes or videos. This technology utilizes computer vision algorithms and image processing techniques to distinguish motorcycle riders and their vehicles from the background, even in low-light conditions.

Motorcycle night ride segmentation has business implications in areas such as traffic surveillance, safety analysis, and law enforcement. By accurately segmenting motorcycles and riders from nighttime scenes, traffic monitoring systems can track motorcycle movement, analyze traffic patterns, and identify potential safety risks. Law enforcement agencies can utilize this technology for traffic law enforcement, crime prevention, or accident investigations. It contributes to improved road safety, enhanced traffic management, and effective law enforcement measures.
