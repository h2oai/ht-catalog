### Business Problem 

Football player segmentation in images leverages computer vision techniques to extract and separate individual players from a static image. By isolating players from the background, this technology enables various applications, including player statistics analysis, team formation evaluation, and immersive fan experiences, enhancing the understanding and enjoyment of football imagery.

### Impact

Football player segmentation use-case is highly beneficial in the sports industry, including sports broadcasting, team analysis, and fan engagement. By accurately segmenting players from game footage, broadcasters can provide enhanced visual experiences, highlight specific player actions, and deliver more engaging sports content to viewers. Sports teams and analysts can utilize player segmentation for performance analysis, tactical evaluations, and injury prevention strategies. It contributes to improved sports coverage, enhanced fan experiences, and data-driven decision-making in professional football.

### Dataset
