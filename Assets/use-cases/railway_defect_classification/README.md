### Business Problem 

Railway defect classification involves the automated identification and categorization of defects or anomalies in railway infrastructure, such as tracks, switches, or signals. This technology utilizes computer vision algorithms and machine learning models to analyze images or video data captured during railway inspections and classify them into specific defect categories, such as cracks, breaks, or wear.

Railway defect classification has significant business implications in the transportation and railway maintenance industry. By automating the defect identification process, railway operators can improve safety measures, optimize maintenance schedules, and enhance overall infrastructure reliability. It allows for proactive maintenance planning, reduces downtime, and mitigates the risk of accidents or disruptions, resulting in improved operational efficiency and cost savings.

### Dataset

300 train images with their labels(Defective or Non Defective)
