### Business Problem 

Crack Detection model is used to detect and locate cracks in various surfaces. This model is useful for engineers and maintenance professionals, helping them to monitor and maintain the safety and structural integrity of buildings and infrastructure.

### Impact

The surface crack classifier has substantial business impact in industries such as infrastructure, construction, and manufacturing. By automatically identifying and classifying surface cracks on structures, such as buildings, bridges, and pipelines, it aids in proactive maintenance and inspection. This technology enables early detection of cracks, facilitating timely repairs and preventing potential safety hazards. Industries can benefit from cost savings by minimizing the need for manual inspections and conducting targeted maintenance based on the severity and location of the detected cracks. Moreover, it enhances overall infrastructure reliability and safety, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.
